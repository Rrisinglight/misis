                  ABOUT NUMERICAL RECIPES IN PASCAL

This  NUMERICAL RECIPES PASCAL    SHAREWARE DISKETTE  contains  Pascal
procedures originally published as the Pascal Appendix  to the FORTRAN
book NUMERICAL RECIPES: THE ART OF SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING by William  H.
Press, Saul A. Teukolsky, Brian P. Flannery, and William T. Vetterling
(Cambridge   University  Press,  1986),  and   test   driver  programs
originally  published as  the NUMERICAL RECIPES EXAMPLE  BOOK (PASCAL)
(Cambridge  University Press,  1986).  All  procedures and programs on
this disk are   Copyright (C) 1986  by   Numerical  Recipes  Software.
Please read the file NRREADME.DOC to learn the  conditions under which
you may use these programs for free.

The   procedures on  this  diskette are    translations  from FORTRAN.
Subsequently, new versions of all the procedures have been written, in
native Pascal, and a new, all-Pascal  edition of the NUMERICAL RECIPES
book  has been  published.   These new  materials are available, at  a
modest  cost,   from  Cambridge    University   Press.   Here  follows
information on  ordering  the new  materials,   the  book's table   of
contents and list of included programs:

The book, and diskettes of the REVISED (non-shareware) programs can be
ordered by  telephone:  800-872-7423  [in   NY: 800-227-0247];  or  by
writing Cambridge University Press, 110 Midland  Avenue, Port Chester,
NY 10573.  Current prices at the time of writing are: Book (hardcover)
(37516-9) $44.50.  Diskette (37532-0) $29.95; Example Book (paperback)
(37675-0)  $19.95; Example   Diskette  (37533-9)  $24.95.   NOTE:  The
example book and diskette presume that you also have the main book and
diskette; they are not useful by themselves.
