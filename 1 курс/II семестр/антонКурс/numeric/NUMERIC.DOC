          This archive contains the following files. They are all concerned 
          with some aspect of numerical analysis. In most cases the 
          programs include a reference to their source. Perhaps the most 
          generally useful and understandable text is 'Applied Numerical 
          Analysis', Curtis F. Gerald -- his sample programs are about as 
          structured as it is possible to be in Fortran. Harley Flanders' 
          'Scientific Pascal' has excellent sample programs, but is not 
          very strong on the theory behind them. Whether you feel like 
          looking up the theory or not, it usually a good idea to test the 
          program by running it on a case where the analytic answer is 
          known.

    Leave a message if you have any problems with this stuff, but any 
    numerical analysis text will probably be more helpful than I can.
