<H1>TequilaCat BookReader user manual</H1>

<P>This document explains how to read books on your mobile phone, using 
TequilaCat BookReader.</P>
<P>Bookreader understands number of frequently used e-book formats like RTF, 
TCR, MS Office formats, Adobe PDF etc. Still Bookreader is optimized to view 
plain text format (TXT), and does not display colors/font styles etc.</P>
<P>This help file explains usage of latest version on moment of its writing, 
<em>TequilaCat BookReader 2.2.5</em>. The contents could be generally applied to all 2.x versions, with some 
restrictions. Some described features are missing in older versions, other ones 
are mentioned shortly, another ones are not described, since (I may hope) 
they’re self-evident.</P>
<P>Please explore the program by clicking buttons options pressing phone buttons 
etc. I tried to follow user feedback to provide as much user friendliness as I 
could.</P>
<H1>General usage</H1>
<OL>
  <LI>You convert e-books on your computer from original format (text, RTF, PDF 
  etc) into Java format, suitable for mobile phones. 
  <LI>Then you install these java files you’ve created into your mobile phone, 
  in a way recommended for your mobile phone. 
  <LI>As these files are installed, they become Java applications on your phone, 
  each application for each java file you’ve installed. These are books - when 
  you run them you see the text, can scroll and read. </LI></OL>
<P>Created Java books are in format of <B>J</B>ava Application <B>Ar</B>chive 
(<B>JAR</B>). Below I frequently use JAR, it means the same as Java application 
file, or Java book file.</P>
<P>Also (optionally) a JAD file can be created for each JAR file. JAD is short 
text file containing its JAR file name and size plus some additional info. Some 
phones require this short JAD file to install created JAR books, some phones do 
not – refer to documentation to your phone.</P>
<P>Each JAR file created by BookReader shell contains the book text, the fonts 
you selected and the BookReader Mobile Java program (so called MIDlet) that 
actually displays the book text.</P>
<P><B>Please note:</B> separate jar files available on BookReader’ site are 
demonstration programs only. They contain short demo texts and do not allow you 
to view your own books.</P>
<H1>Creation of Java books</H1>
<P>Creation of Java Books is done using TequilaCat BookReader shell.</P>
<P>This is MS Windows program that you downloaded. This program allows you to 
choose e-books stored on your computer, to set desired options and to generate 
java files for your mobile phone.</P>
<P>Most important features of the shell are:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Selecting books for conversion into Java format 
  <LI>Editing table of contents 
  <LI>Selecting various options of books you’re gonna create 
  <LI>Choosing fonts and colors to display text with 
  <LI>Configuring phone key actions if needed </LI></UL>
<P>They are explained in details along with other options.</P>
<H2>BookReader shell window</H2>
<P>BookReader shell window is split onto several areas.</P>
<P>Left top corner contains fields where you fill in a book name you’re gonna 
create, and allows you to select a model of your phone.</P>
<P>Below you see the task tree where all actions and settings of the BookReader 
are available. The tasks in the tree are grouped. The first group deals with 
e-books you convert into BookReader java format, the second group allows 
changing various options and settings, and the third group allows setting fonts 
for books,</P>
<P>Clicking tasks in the tree brings up related controls at the right side of 
the window, and performs related tasks.</P>
<P>At right side you see options and controls corresponding to the task you’ve 
selected in the task tree.</P>
<P>At bottom you access the main actions: conversion of books, viewing this help 
file and exiting the BookReader.</P>
<H2>Adding books</H2>
<P>When you start shell first time it contains no books. Now you’re ready to add 
new books to convert them into the phone format.</P>
<P>BookReader shell understands frequently used e-book formats: plain text, RTF, 
Adobe Acrobat PDF, MS Office, PDB/PRC (Palm e-books), HLP ? HTML. They are 
converted into the plain text when creating books, so no colors/font 
styles/embedded images are displayed on the phone (yet).</P>
<P>Also BookReader shell understands frequently used archive formats: ZIP, RAR, 
HA, ARJ. When you add an archive, all contained books of supported formats are 
added. Archives may be nested, e.g. RAR may contain ZIP, and ZIP may contain 
e.g. PDF or PDB e-books.</P>
<P>Please note: some formats are optional (require downloads), to keep 
installation small.</P>
<P>You may click an “Add books” task, or drag and drop files from the Windows 
explorer. The books are added then, and optionally split into chapters if this 
option is enabled.</P>
<P>All the added books are displayed as tree, chapters nodes attached to the 
book node.</P>
<P>When a node is selected its text is displayed at right side, in content 
preview area. Large books take long time to preview on slow machines, so by 
default only 2000 symbols are displayed. Checking the corresponding checkbox 
displays whole text or selected chapter.</P>
<P>When you close the BookReader shell, all selected books, their tables of 
contents and the selected options are stored till next time.</P>

<h3>Reading text files from flash card</h3>
<P>If your phone model supports “file system”
(Siemens, Nokia 6230i, SE K750 W800 and similar, latest Motorola phones), 
you may set up and install BookReader once, and read books stored on 
your phone' flash card or in memory. Thus you don't need a PC with shell to compose 
a new book - just send a text file to the phone via IRDA|Bluetooth 
or copy it to the flash card. <p/>
When creating a JAR file in shell, select appropriate model 
(labeled with "file access" or FS) select fonts, configure options, create JAR and
install it into the phone. <p/>
When started, it will display a file and folder view where you can select and open 
text files like in file explorer. When a book is opened, enter main menu, there will be
an "Open file..." item that brings up file/folder view again.<p/>

<P><B>Please note</B>: Books in the phone folder should be in plain text only. 
All text book format conversion is done in the shell, before JAR file creation. 
The Java BookReader understands plain text only.</P>

<H2>Splitting book onto chapters</H2>
<P>Chapter splitting pane is located above the list of books. It defines how the 
text will be split into the chapters. If enabled, every added book is split onto 
chapters. Otherwise you can always re-split chapters with “Reformat chapters” 
task or small “recycle” button on the pane.</P>
<P>The most important option is the list of words starting chapter headers, like 
prologue, epilogue, and part. &nbsp;By default also Roman and Arabic letters 
with dot are considered as chapter headers, like <B>12. title</B> or <B>XXI. 
title</B> .</P>
<P>Also you may specify that line containing a single number is a chapter 
header.</P>
<P>If the original e-book file has been changed by external program, it is 
reloaded. So you may edit the file in some word processor to fix the correct 
chapters, and reformat the text after saving changes.</P>
<P>Sometimes default chapter splitting is not good. To make clear table of 
contents you may merge and rename chapters and books.</P>
<P><B>Note to expert users:</B> </P>
<P>Chapter headers are treated as regexp template. Before book splitting, commas 
are replaced with pipes, and () are added. So <I>Chapter,Part,Foreword</I> is 
converted into the ^((?:\d+$)|Chapter|Part|Foreword) </P>
<P>\d+$ are added if “use single numbers as chapter headers” is opted.</P>
<P>Looks familiar, yeah? When “Use regexps” is clicked the field content is not 
converted – use direct PerlRE, and Power be with you.</P>
<H2>Selecting various options</H2>
<P>Most important fields are in top left corners. These are <B>Phone model</B>, 
<B>Midlet name</B> and <B>Jar file name</B>.</P>
<P><B>Phone model</B> should match your phone. Each phone has its own features 
and selecting correct model is important.</P>
<P>If your exact phone is not listed, try selecting a phone of the same brand. 
If this does not work, select MIDP1.0 for older phones and MIDP2.0 for newer 
ones.&nbsp; MIDP is a version of Java installed in your phone. You can find your 
exact Java version in tech. manual on your phone.</P>
<P>Selecting <B>Phone model</B> affects some options, enabling features 
available for particular models only, and setting model-dependent fields. Also 
this defines font preview page appearance.</P>
<P><B>Midlet name</B> is name of book. This is how the java book will be labeled 
in the list of installed java applications, in the phone.</P>
<P>If the book name is too long or contains non-English national letters, the 
phone may refuse to install it. If you have problems with installation of such 
books, try renaming them with Latin letters no more than 8-10 characters 
length.</P>
<P><B>Jar file name</B> is how the created Java book files will be named on your 
computer. If you opt “create each book in its folder” this is also the name of 
the folder.</P>
<P>Clicking on <B>“Configure”</B> group caption you see the controls defining 
where Java books will be created, and how.</P>
<P>You choose where books will be created: in the specific folder or in the 
folder of source book.</P>
<P>You may protect your books with password.</P>
<P>You may choose what to do when the java books are created: open folder, run 
some program or just do nothing, and define whether the program should exit on 
successful book conversion.</P>
<P><B>“Change appearance”</B> task brings up selection of icons for java book 
folders on computer, and for a book in phone. If you opt “create each book in 
its folder”, these folders are optionally pictured with the icon you select.</P>
<P><B>“Set options”</B> item allows selection of java book properties. Most 
important are <B>Max Jar Size</B> and T<B>ext block size</B>.</P>
<P><B>Max Jar Size</B> is maximal size of Java application (Jar file) accepted 
by your phone. For some phones this information is predefined, but for some 
newer or rare phones you should try to find it manually.</P>
<P>Usually the allowed jar sizes are 50.000 and more. E.g. Nokia 6310 is limited 
to 32000, Nokia S40 (most their non-smartphones are S40) is limited to 
64.000.</P>
<P>When a book can’t fit into the maximal allowed JAR size, it’s split into 
several JAR files like book_1, book_2 etc (instead of <B>book_</B>, given JAR 
file name is used). These files can be installed into phone one by one, or all 
together.</P>
<P>If the java book is created OK but <U>you cannot install it in your 
phon</U>e, the chances are big you’ve exceeded Jar size limit. Typical reported 
errors are “Bad Jar File”, “Jar file too big”.</P>
<P><B>Text block size</B> is a size of a single text fragment. It sounds quite 
mystic, so I’ll try to explain this. When the book is converted into the Java 
book the original text is split onto smaller fragments, which is done to 
increase performance and convenience of reading.</P>
<P>Typically most phones allow for text fragments 30.000 to 100.000 bytes. Old 
Siemens’s (up to 45<SUP>th</SUP> series, and CF62) allow for maximum 8000 
only.</P>
<P>When the fragment size is set too small, the number of text fragments grows 
big; this results in bigger Java book sizes. Also when you read the text 
fragments are read one by one, freezing book reading for some moments. The 
smaller the fragment is the more frequent freezes you meet.</P>
<P>When the fragment size is set too big there’s a risk your phone has not 
enough free memory. In this case the book will crash when you try to open it 
(run it) in the list of installed java programs. If you experience crashes when 
you <U>run successfully installed (downloaded)</U> book, try decreasing this 
size.</P>
<P>There’s no point to make it less than 8000, since errors may occur, and all 
phones should allow this size at least.</P>
<H2>Configuring phone keys</H2>
<P>“<B>Change key mapping</B>” task brings up the key configuration pane.</P>


<P>Initially it shows default mapping of phone keys to the actions available in 
BookReader MIDlet in the phone.</P>
<P>You can override existing mapping by right-clicking on key mapping or on empty cell.
In the popup menu you can select desired key to bind to the clicked action, 
or enter key code, or select top menu item "-" to unbind a key from an action.
All overridden bindings (different from default ones) are shown in bold. You may also  
reset key bindings to default keys.</P>
<P>You can select standard keys (0-9, *, #, DIAL/Joystick and directions keys), 
and the key codes for phone specific buttons (Soft keys). If you select the “Key 
code:” in the “Keys” dropdown list, fill in the key code for the key you want to 
assign. Actual key codes are shown by BookReader MIDlet in the phone (Info 
menu-&gt;Show key codes).</P>



<H2>Text preview</H2>
<P>Clicking on “<B>Fonts/Preview</B>” group caption you see the “Fonts” page. 
There you define fonts with which a book is displayed, and preview how it looks 
on your phone.</P>
<P>The preview displays <B>roughly</B> how the text will look on your phone. 
Exactly same text display is hard to achieve, I am sorry but I write BookReader 
for mobile phones, not for Windows boxes. But still you can estimate how much 
lines you’ll see on phone screen, in a given font.</P>
<P>By default you see default text in preview. Select a text in text preview on 
“Books” page, and it will be shown in “Fonts preview” page.</P>
<P>If your phone configuration is known to BookReader shell, you’ll see screen 
of same size, optionally with the “skin” of your phone. If your phone is not 
listed, it’s not a problem - the BookReader Java program automatically retrieves 
size from the phone, except for some Samsungs and old Motorola models.</P>
<P>If you own such Samsung or old Motorola, and there’s a white strip under the 
text in the phone, try entering correct height and clicking “suppress white 
line”.</P>
<P>Also you can select color of background and letters (for each font), page 
margins, word wrap style, position and type of scrollbar.</P>
<H2>Choosing fonts and colors</H2>
<P>You may select several fonts for a book, and switch between them later when 
you read the book on your phone.</P>
<P>For each font you select its face, size, color, bold/italic style and 
orientation (rotation). <B>To read books with phone rotated in your hand, create 
one or more rotated fonts!</B> </P>
<P>Font may be rotated left and right. Displaying a text with rotated font 
allows better usage of a screen space on screens whose height is bigger than 
width. Also on some phones the manual scrolling is better when they’re 
rotated.</P>
<P>For each font an interline distance can be changed, negative values allow for 
much more compact text (more lines on the screen).</P>
<P>There are 2 types of fonts BookReader can display: phone fonts, and windows 
fonts.</P>
<H3>Windows fonts</H3>
<P>1) Windows fonts are the fonts installed in your Windows OS. When you create 
book with Windows font selected, its copy is put in every jar, taking space as 
5-20 kilobytes of text or even more depending on character size.</P>
<P>The advantage of the Windows fonts:</P>
<P><U>On WinXP</U>, if the “use smooth screen fonts” desktop option is enabled, 
<U>Windows fonts are “smooth”</U> (MS ClearType technology) which gives much 
better reading experience on mobile phone screens.</P>
<P>Also, <U>only Windows fonts can be rotated.</U> </P>
<H3>Phone fonts </H3>
<P>2) Phone fonts are fonts built into every phone. They don’t take much space 
in JAR files, so you’ll have more text per JAR file. Also, Unicode books 
(Chinese, Japanese, and other South-Asian languages) can be displayed in phone 
fonts only.</P>
<P>They are of 3 sizes possible in phones: small, regular and big. Their actual 
pixel size and availability depend on a phone. Some phones have no big or small 
fonts, so all the phone fonts are rendered as regular.</P>
<P><U>Sizes in the shell are given only as example.</U> </P>
<P>BookReader shell cannot know each font pixel size in every model, so you may 
test it on the phone and adjust a pixel height in the shell for each phone font 
(by trial and error).</P>
<P><U>Phone fonts cannot be made “smooth”, and cannot be rotated.</U> </P>
<H2>Saving and restoring state of BookReader shell</H2>
<P>You can save your current state of the shell anytime into the file. 
Bookreader shell stores settings in BKS files (<B>B</B>oo<B>k</B> <B>S</B>et); 
they contain options, fonts and books, including table of contents (chapter 
list).</P>
<P>Later on you may restore the book list and options by opening BKS file or 
drag’n’dropping it, just like opening any book.</P>
<P>If you read books on several phones you may create several templates - BKS 
files without books, with configured fonts/options for each phone, and load them 
before adding actual books.</P>
<P>Please note, the very book texts are not stored into BKS files, only book 
file paths and chapter list. If the book file has been renamed or removed, next 
time you start the shell or load BKS file this book will not be loaded. If the 
book has been modified its table of contents will be reset.</P>


  
  <h1>Optional text formats intallation</h1>
    To keep installation compact, and to avoid license issues, the BookReader installation includes only several of supported format convertors. But still the BookReader is preconfigured to use all of supported formats: all you have to do is to download 
  the converters yourself (URLs are provided below), and to put these converters into <code>plugins</code> subfolder of the shell installation folder.
  <p/>
  How to install: <p/>
  <ul>
    <li>download a convertor from an URL listed below
  <li>install (unpack) it to temporary directory
    <li>copy essential files to the <code>plugins</code> subfolder of the shell installation folder. 
  Or, copy them to the folder included in PATH variable.
    <li>restart shell, the convertor should be listed in the "Plugins" page of the shell.
  </ul>
  Some of the converters , e.g. archive software, may already be installed on your computer. Check shell's "Plugins" page before downloading converters, they may be already available in BookReader shell.

  In such case, use google to find appropriate package, as I did.
  
  <h2>Adding new formats support</h2>
  
  Any archive or text format support may be added into BookReader shell, given that you have an EXE file of converter
  working from command line. <br>
  For details refer to the <code>plugins\*.pd</code> files. PD stands for Plugin Description.
  <p/>
  Also text postprocessors could be configured, that process plain text changing its formatting or encoding. E.g. russian users can enjoy automatic cyrillic encoding recognition.<br>
  If you want you may configure external text formatters for plain text rectification (removal of empty lines, ends of lines etc).
  To define a converter as plain text postprocessor, omit extension list from the plugin description.
